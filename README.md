# Embed-Site
Embed Site Testing — demo site for adding embeds to pages.

## View online

After you push and enable Pages, the site is at:

**https://abarnish1024.github.io/Embed-Site/**

## Get it online

1. **Push** this repo to GitHub (including the new `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`).
2. In the repo on GitHub: **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
4. On the next push to `main`, the workflow will run and deploy. You can also run it manually: **Actions → Deploy to GitHub Pages → Run workflow**.

The workflow deploys the **Cursor Vibe** folder (your embed demo) to GitHub Pages.
